# Machine-Learning
In this project I performed a nested cross-validation and a k-nearest neighbour algorithm, built confusion matrices, and estimated the distances between data samples.

In this coursework I worked with the Wine dataset. This is a 178 sample dataset that categorises 3 different types of Italian wine using 13 different features. The code loads the Wine dataset and selects a subset of features to work with.
